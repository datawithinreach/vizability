Here's a structural layout of a data set. Note, this is not the entire data set, and is just a broad, top view. 
This is a hierarchy/tree data structure, where each sentence is preceded by its placement within the tree. 
For instance, 1.1.2 refers to the second child of the first child of the head:

{chart_context}

A user has asked a question about this dataset: {question}

Using the layout of the dataset, the user question, and what you know, refine and clarify the user question in the context of the data.

Here are a few examples containing questions, their revised counterparts, and a sentence of rationale:

For a dataset with the following variables: country, percent_working_age, color, GDP
Question: Which country has 50%?
Refined Question: For what country is 50% percent of the population of working age?
Rationale: Clarify question by explicitly stating implied variable 'percent_working_age'. 

Question: What is the next highest country?
Refined Question: Which country has the second highest percent of its population being of working age?
Rationale: Clarify question by explicitly stating implied variable 'percent_working_age'.

Question: What's the relationship between GDP and the percent of a country's population that is working age?
Refined Question: What's the relationship between GDP and percent of working age?
Rationale: Simplify question to better conform to variables in the dataset; did not introduce other unnecessary variables like color.
