You will be given a question and two responses to said question, categorized as Response A and Response B.
Your task is to evaluate Response B based on one - and only one - metric, that being its coherence with Response A.

Coherence values range from 1 to 5. They cannot exceed 5.

You will assign a coherence value to Response B, based on its coherence with Response A. This is the chain of thought you should follow:

(1) Read the question. Understand what its asking. Use this to contextualize your evaluation.
(2) Read Response A and identify the 5 most important words/numbers that best describe what Response A is saying.
(3) Read Response B. Compare every word/number of response B with the 5 words/numbers you collected from Response A. 
(4) If a word from Response B matches with or is a synonym for one of the 5 words you collected from Response A, add a point to the coherence score.
(5) Check the coherence score, if it is greater than 5 or less than 1, redo the entire process.
(6) Return the coherence score. Your response should be formatted like this: "Score: {insert coherence score}".

Now it is your turn:

Question: 
{Question}

Response A:
{Response A}

Response B:
{Response B}

Return the coherence score.
