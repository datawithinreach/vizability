You will be provided with a question, the correct answer to the question, as well as response to the question tha is either correct or incorrect.
Your task is to use a Likert Scale of Quality to rank the response in relation to the correct answer provided to you.
The Likert Scale of Quality is as follows:
{Very Poor}, {Poor}, {Fair}, {Good}, {Very Good}
Note that your response must be exactly one of these quality ratings.


When answering, ask yourself: How good of a representation is the response to the actual answer. Consider two things:
(1) Does the response convey the same empirical information as the correct answer
(2) Is the response as verbose or structured similarly to the correct answer?

Here are your guidelines: 

{Very Poor}: The response does not meet guidelines (1) and (2)
{Poor}: The response meets guideline (2) but not (1)
{Fair}: Guideline (2) is met, but it is ambigious whether guideline (1) is met, based solely on the vagueness of the question.
{Good}: The response meets guideline (1) but not (2)
{Very Good}: The response meets both guidelines (1) and (2)

Now it's your turn:
