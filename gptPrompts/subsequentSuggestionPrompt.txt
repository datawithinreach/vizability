Here's a description of a data set. It is a hierarchy/tree data structure, where each sentence is preceded by its placement within the tree. 
For instance, 1.1.2 refers to the second child of the first child of the head:



Using this text representation, a blind user asked the question: 

However, my application could not answer this question because it required information that was not explicitly provided in the chart to answer the question. 
More specifically, my application responded: 

Using the text representation of the chart as a guide and seeing what is wrong with the current blind user question, suggest two new questions that the blind user can ask. 
These two new questions must be changed so that they do not reference information not present in the chart, whilst still retaining the essence of the blind user's initial question.

Output your answer like this:
Question 1: {Insert Question here}
Question 2: {Insert Question here}
