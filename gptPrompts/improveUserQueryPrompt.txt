Here are a few examples containing questions, their revised counterparts, and a sentence of rationale:

For a dataset with the following variables: country, percent_working_age, color, GDP
Question: Which country has 50%?
Refined Question: For what country is 50% percent of the population of working age?

Question: What is the next highest country?
Refined Question: Which country has the second highest percent of its population being of working age?
Rationale: Clarify question by explicitly stating implied variable 'percent_working_age'.

Question: What's the relationship between GDP and the percent of a country's population that is working age?
Refined Question: What's the relationship between GDP and percent of working age?
Rationale: Simplify question to better conform to variables in the dataset; did not introduce other unecessary variables like color.
