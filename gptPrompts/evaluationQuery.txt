You will be provided a question about a dataset and two accompanying responses, titled Response A and Response B. 

Using the provided question for context, your task is to evaluate Response B's coherence to Response A.

Evaluate Response B by this metric according to this scale:

1 - The content of Response B is irrelevant to that of Response A and bears no similarities
2 - The content of Response B is somewhat irrelevant to that of Response A; the core information in Response B does not match that of Response A
3 - It is unclear whether there are any similarities between Response A and Response B due to the ambiguity of one or two of the Responses
4 - Response B is mostly similar to Response A but may lack some of the more specific key details such as labels
5 - Response B is not only similar but also faithful to Response A

Provide one sentence of reasoning behind your answer.
Format your answer like this:

Here are some examples:

Question: What was the average amount of houses sold in 2015?
Response A: On average, 1327792.6346153845 homes were for sale in 2015?
Response B: The average inventory in 2015 was approximately 1,327,793.
Reasoning: The key information (average number of houses sold) is identical for both Responses; in addition, Response B is equally as explanatory as Response A.
Score: 5

Question: What was the average amount of houses sold in 2015?
Response A: On average, 1327792.6346153845 homes were for sale in 2015?
Response B: 1,327,793.
Reasoning: Although the core information conveyed by Response B is identical to that of Response A, Response B lacks the explanatory wording of Response A.
Score: 4

Question: What country in Africa has the lowest vaccination rate?
Response A: Burundi has the lowest vaccination rate
Response B: The country in Africa with the lowest vaccination rate is Malawi.
Reasoning: The core information for Response B (Malawi) does not match Response A (Burundi); however, Response B is worded similarly to Response A.
Score: 2

Question: Is Africa the country that needs the vaccine the most?
Response A: Africa is not a country, however it is the continent with the lowest average vaccination rate.
Response B: No, Africa is not the country that needs the vaccine the most because Africa is a continent, not a country. The country with the lowest percentage of fully vaccinated people in the provided dataset has a vaccination rate of 0.3%. However, this does not necessarily mean that this country needs the vaccine the most, as there are many other factors to consider.
Reasoning: Response B is more explanatory than Response A and conveys the same core information
Score: 5

Question: What is the second highest GDP per capita?
Response A: The second highest GDP per capita is $45,675.
Response B: Malawi has the second highest GDP per capita.
Reasoning: Responses B and A convey two completely different variables. However, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the two. If Malawi were to have a GDP per capita of $45,675 then Response B would receive a high score. If this were not the case Response B would receive a low score. The situation is ambiguous.
Score: 3

Question: What is the average number of houses for sale for the year 2015?
Response A: On average, 1,460,000 houses were for sale throughout 2015.
Response B: The average number of houses for sale is not defined in the data.
Reasoning: Response B is irrelevant to Response A.
Score: 1

Question: What day had the third highest number of homes for sale?
Response A: The third highest number of homes were on sale on 2021-02-05.
Response B: February 5, 2021 had the third highest number of homes for sale.
Reasoning: Although the dates are expressed in a different format, they are nonetheless the same date; response B is equally as explanatory as Response A.
Score: 1
