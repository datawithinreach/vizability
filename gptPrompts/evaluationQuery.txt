You will be provided a question about a dataset and two accompanying responses, titled Response A and Response B. 

Using the provided question for context, your task is to evaluate Response B's consistency with Response A. 
When evaluating, use a bifocal vantage point: make sure that individual key details and numbers correspond; however, you should also check if the overall quality of Response B (verboseness, thoroughness, the supporting of claims with evidence) corresponds to Response A.

Evaluate Response B by this metric according to this scale:

1 - The content of Response B is irrelevant to that of Response A and bears no similarities
2 - The content of Response B is somewhat irrelevant to that of Response A; the core information in Response B does not match that of Response A
3 - There are some inconsistencies between Response B and Response A, potentially stemming from the ambiguity of the Question (ie, the question can be interpreted multiple ways).
4 - Response B is mostly consistent with Response A but the overall quality of Response B is lower than Response A because of missing labels, improper formatting, or overly technical language.
5 - Response B is consistent with Response A and provides a relevant, thorough, high-quality, and well supported answer to the Question.

Here are some examples:

Question: What was the average inventory of houses for sale in 2015?
Response A: On average, 1,327,792.6346153845 homes were for sale in 2015.
Response B: The average inventory in 2015 was approximately 1,327,793.
Reasoning: The desired information (average number of houses sold) is near identical for both Responses, accounting for a small margin of error due to rounding; in addition, the numerical answer in Response B is properly formatted with commas, just like in Response A.
Score: 5

Question: What was the average inventory of houses for sale in 2015?
Response A: On average, 1,327,792.6346153845 homes were for sale in 2015.
Response B: 1,327,793.
Reasoning: Although the desired information (average number of houses sold) is near identical for both Responses, accounting for a small margin of error due to rounding, Response B is missing labels and is therefore not as explanatory as Response A.
Score: 4

Question: What was the average amount of houses sold in 2015?
Response A: The chart does not display any information about the inventory of houses sold for any given time period. Instead, the data depicts the inventory of houses for sale.
Response B: On average, 1,327,792.6346153845 homes were for sale in 2015.
Reasoning: Although the answer outputted by the model may be factually correct, it is not relevant to the question, which asks for inventory sold and not inventory for sale.
Score: 2

Question: What country in Africa has the lowest vaccination rate?
Response A: Burundi has the lowest vaccination rate
Response B: The country in Africa with the lowest vaccination rate is Malawi.
Reasoning: The desired information in Response B (Malawi) is not consistent with Response A (Burundi).
Score: 1

Question: Is Africa the country that needs the vaccine the most?
Response A: Africa is not a country, however it is the continent with the lowest average vaccination rate.
Response B: No, Africa is not the country that needs the vaccine the most because Africa is a continent, not a country. The country with the lowest percentage of fully vaccinated people in the provided dataset has a vaccination rate of 0.3%. However, this does not necessarily mean that this country needs the vaccine the most, as there are many other factors to consider.
Reasoning: Response B is more explanatory than Response A and conveys the same core information
Score: 5

Question: What is the second highest GDP per capita?
Response A: The second highest GDP per capita is $45,675.
Response B: Malawi has the second highest GDP per capita.
Reasoning: Responses B and A convey two completely different variables. However, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the two. If Malawi were to have a GDP per capita of $45,675 then Response B would receive a high score. If this were not the case Response B would receive a low score. The situation is ambiguous because the Question can be interpreted in multiple ways.
Score: 3

Question: What is the average number of houses for sale for the year 2015?
Response A: On average, 1,460,000 houses were for sale throughout 2015.
Response B: The average number of houses for sale is not defined in the data.
Reasoning: Response B is not consistent with Response A. Whereas, Response A states a clear and defined number, Response B has an inconclusive response.
Score: 1

Question: What day had the third highest number of homes for sale?
Response A: The third highest number of homes were on sale on 2021-02-05.
Response B: February 5, 2021 had the third highest number of homes for sale.
Reasoning: Although the dates are expressed in a different format, they are nonetheless the same date; response B is equally as explanatory as Response A.
Score: 1
