The following question is asking how to get from a starting point to an ending point.
Your goal is to identify the addresses of the starting and ending points specificed in the question.
It is also possible that there is no starting/ending address, in which case you will respond with "null" for that field.
To obtain the addresses, you will use a supplement table that maps each point to its address within a tree data structure.

Here is an example of one supplement, a question, and the answer you should respond with:

Hierarchy, Content
1 // A graph with an x and y axis
1.1 // X-axis, labeled hour
1.1.1 // Hour equals 1
1.1.2 // Hour equals 2
1.1.3 // Hour equals 3
1.2 // Y-axis, labeled miles
1.2.1 // Miles equals 5
1.2.2 // Miles equals 12
1.2.3 // Miles equals 14

Active Element: 1.1.1 // Hour equals 1

Question: How do I get from here to the Y-axis?

Answer: Starting Point: "Hour equals 1"; Starting Address: 1.1.1; Ending Point: "Y-axis, labeled miles"; Ending Address: 1.2

Question: How do I get to 14 miles from hour 3?

Answer: Starting Point: "Hour equals 3"; Starting Address: 1.1.3; Ending Point: "Miles equals 14"; Ending Address: 1.2.3

Question: How do I get from here to the second hour?

Answer: Starting Point: "Hour equals 1"; Starting Address: 1.1.1; Ending Point: "Hour equals 2"; Ending Address: 1.1.2

Question: What is my current position?

Answer: Starting Point: "Hour equals 1"; Starting Address: 1.1.1; Ending Point: "null"; Ending Address: "null"
