Below is a description of a data set. Each line of the data set has a sentence and an accompanying address, which represents its place in the hierarchical tree data structure.

Here is an example of how the address scheme works:
1 // Root
1.1 // Child 1
1.1.1 // Child 1 of Child 1
1.1.2 // Child 2 of Child 1
1.2 // Child 2
1.3 // Child 3
1.3.1 // Child 1 of Child 3
1.3.1.1 // Child 1 of Child 1 of Child 3
1.3.1.2 // Child 2 of Child 1 of Child 3

Furthermore, my model also supports navigation to each item in the data structure using the computer's arrow keys. 
However, I want you to first consider navigation in terms of the addresses and then convert each move to pressing one of the 4 arrow keys.

At each address, the user can only make one of 4 possible moves - if and only if the resulting address is an actual address in the hierarchy:

(Move 1) - Append a ".1" to the adress. This equals pressing the down arrow key.
(Move 2) - Delete the last 2 indexes of the address. This equals pressing the up arrow key.
(Move 3) - Perform integer addition and add 1 to the number in the last index of the address. This equals pressing the right arrow key.
(Move 4) - Perform integer subtraction and subtract 1 from the number in the last index of the address. This equals pressing the left arrow key.

If you use a move that does not explicitly match any of these 4, it is incorrect. Go back and rethink your answer.

Here is an example description and accompanying answer, formatted in a certain way. Use this format when you answer.

Hierarchy,Content
1 // A Simple Graph
1.1 // The X-axis
1.1.1 // The point (1,0,1) with an x-value of 1
1.1.2 // The point (3,1,2) with an x-value of 3
1.2 // The Y-axis
1.2.1 // The point (1,0,1) with a y-value of 0
1.2.2 // The point (3,1,2) with a y-value of 1
1.3 // The Z-axis
1.3.1 // The point (1,0,1) with a z-value of 1
1.3.2 // The point (3,1,2) with a z-value of 2

Question: How do I get from The point (1,0,1) with an x-value of 1 to The Y-axis?

Response: 
1. Press the up arrow key. (Move 2 : 1.1.1 -> 1.1) 
2. Press the right arrow key. (Move 3 : 1.1 -> 1.2)

Question: How do I get from The point (3,1,2) with an x-value of 3 to The point (3,1,2) with a z-value of 2?

Response:
1. Press the up arrow key. (Move 2 : 1.1.2 -> 1.1)
2. Press the right arrow key. (Move 3 : 1.1 -> 1.2)
3. Press the right arrow key. (Move 3 : 1.2 -> 1.3)
4. Press the down arrow key. (Move 1 : 1.3 -> 1.3.1)

Note, at the end of your answer, check whether your end point is the address of the end point specificed in the question.
