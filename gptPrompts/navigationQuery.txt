Below is a description of a data set. Each line of the data set has a sentence and an accompanying address, which represents its place in the hierarchical tree data structure.

Here is an example of how the address scheme works:
1 // Root
1.1 // Child 1
1.1.1 // Grandchild 1
1.1.2 // Grandchild 2
1.2 // Child 2
1.3 // Child 3
1.3.1 // Grandchild 3
1.3.1.1 // Great Grandchild 1
1.3.1.2 // Great Grandchild 2

Furthermore, my model also supports navigation to each item in the data structure using the computer's arrow keys. However, I want you to first consider navigation in terms of the addresses and then convert each move to pressing one of the 4 arrow keys.

At each address, the user can only make one of 4 possible moves - if and only if the resulting address is an actual address in the hierarchy:

(Move 1) - Append a ".1" to the right-hand side of the address; for instance, 1.1 -> 1.1.1 This travels down a level in the tree structure, and its corresponding user move is pressing the down arrow key.
(Move 2) - Detach a ".1" from the right-hand side of the address; for instance, 1.1.1 -> 1.1 This travels up a level in the tree structure, and its corresponding user move is pressing the up arrow key.
(Move 3) - Perform mathematical addition and add integer 1 to the rightmost digit in the address; for instance, 1.1 -> 1.2 This travels one space to the right in the tree structure, and its corresponding user move is pressing the right arrow key.
(Move 4) - Perform mathematical subtraction and subtract integer 1 from the rightmost digit in the address; for instance, 1.2 -> 1.1 This travels one space to the left in the tree structure, and its corresponding user move is pressing the left arrow key.

If you use a move that does not explicitly match any of these 4, it is incorrect. Go back and rethink your answer.

Here is an example description and accompanying answer, formatted in a certain way. Use this format when you answer.

Hierarchy,Content
1 // A Simple Graph
1.1 // The X-axis
1.1.1 // The point (1,0) with an x-value of 1
1.1.2 // The point (3,1) with an x-value of 3
1.2 // The Y-axis
1.2.1 // The point (1,0) with a y-value of 0
1.2.2 // The point (3,1) with a y-value of 1

Question: How do I get from 1.1.1 to 1.2?

Response: 
Starting Position: 1.1.1 // The point (1,0) with an x-value of 1.
1. Press the up arrow key to go up one level (Move 2). Current Position: 1.1 // The X-axis
2. Press the right arrow key to move one space to the right (Move 3). Current Position: 1.2 // The Y-axis

Question: How do I get from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2?

Response:
Starting Position: 1.1.1 // The point (1,0) with an x-value of 1.
1. Press the right arrow key to move one space to the right (Move 3). Current Position: 1.1.2 // The point (3,1) with an x-value of 3

Now it's your turn. Below is the description of a dataset:
