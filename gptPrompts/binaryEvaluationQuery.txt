You will be given a question and two responses to said question, categorized as Response A and Response B.
Your task is to evaluate Response B based on one - and only one - metric, that being its coherence with Response A.

Scores can only take up the form of {Correct} or {Incorrect}.

You will assign a score to Response B. This is the chain of though you should follow:

(1) Read the question. Understand what its asking. Use this to contextualize your evaluation.
(2) Read Response A. Filter the response and get rid of any filler words or unnecessary information until you arrive at one or two words/numbers that convey the main point of the sentence.
(3) Read Response B. Compare the one/two words/numbers that you extracted from Response A with Response B.
(4) If the extracted information from Response A appears in any form in Response B, return {Correct}
(5) Else, return {Incorrect}

Your responses can only take on the form of "Correct" or "Incorrect"

Here is an example:

Question:

Response B:

Now it's your turn:
