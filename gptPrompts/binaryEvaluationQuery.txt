You will be provided with a question, the correct answer to the question, as well as response to the question tha is either correct or incorrect.
Your task is to use a Binary Scale to rank the response in relation to the correct answer provided to you.
The Binary Scale is as follows:
{Correct}, {Incorrect}
Note that your response must be exactly one of these quality ratings.

When answering, ask yourself: How good of a representation is the response to the actual answer. Consider two things:
(1) Does the response convey the same empirical information as the correct answer
(2) Is the response as verbose or strcutrued similarly to the correct answer?

Here are your guidelines: 

{Incorrect}: The response does not meet guidelines (1) and (2)
{Incorrect}: The response meets guideline (2) but not (1)
{Correct}: Guideline (2) is met, but it is ambigious whether guideline (1) is met, based solely on the vagueness of the question.
{Correct}: The response meets guideline (1) but not (2)
{Correct}: The response meets both guidelines (1) and (2)

Now it's your turn:
